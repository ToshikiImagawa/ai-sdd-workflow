# SysML Requirements Diagram Theory

## Position of Requirements Diagrams

In SysML, requirement diagrams describe the requirements and constraints imposed on a system, clarifying the system's rationale.

| **Definition & Purpose**   | Diagrams that describe requirements and constraints imposed on a system (processing response time, security, etc.) used for requirement analysis   |
| **Type Name/Abbreviation** | Requirement Diagram / `req`                                                                                                                        |
| **Uniqueness**             | SysML newly defined requirement diagrams as **diagrams that describe requirements themselves**, which were lacking in UML                          |
| **Role in SysML**          | SysML diagrams are broadly classified into structural diagrams, behavioral diagrams, and **requirement diagrams** representing system requirements |

## Requirement Classification

Requirements refer to system objectives and constraints, classified from several perspectives.

| Classification             | Definition                                                            | Example                                                      |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Requirements**      | What users want from the system                                       | System capabilities like "purchase products" or "make payment" |
| **Technical Requirements** | Technical capabilities the system must have to satisfy user requirements | "Electronic money server communication" to enable "electronic payment" |
| **Functional Requirements** | Specific functions required of the system                            | "Purchase product" function                                  |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | Requirements not related to function, such as usability, processing time, response time | Response time from purchase button press to completion     |
