# TDD Cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

## TDD Cycle for Each Task

```
1. RED: Write failing test
   - Define expected behavior
   - Test should fail (no implementation yet)
   - Commit: "test: add test for {feature}"

2. GREEN: Make test pass
   - Write minimum code to pass test
   - Confirm test succeeds
   - Commit: "feat: implement {feature}"

3. REFACTOR: Clean up code
   - Improve structure without changing behavior
   - Confirm all tests still pass
   - Commit: "refactor: clean up {feature}"
```
