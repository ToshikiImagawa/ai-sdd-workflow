# Execution Rules per Phase

## Phase 1: Setup

```
1. Create directory structure
2. Create type definition files
3. Define basic interfaces
4. Setup test environment
```

**Completion Criteria**: All foundation files created and tests runnable

## Phase 2: Tests

```
1. Check test tasks in tasks.md
2. Create failing tests for each feature
3. Run tests and confirm Red (failure)
4. Mark [x] in tasks.md
```

**Completion Criteria**: All test cases created and failing as expected

## Phase 3: Core

```
1. Implement corresponding to tests created in Phase 2
2. Implement to make tests Green (pass)
3. Use minimum implementation (avoid over-implementation)
4. Mark [x] in tasks.md
```

**Completion Criteria**: All core tests passing

## Phase 4: Integration

```
1. Write integration tests between modules first
2. Run integration tests and confirm Red
3. Implement integration parts to make them Green
4. Mark [x] in tasks.md
```

**Completion Criteria**: Integration tests passing

## Phase 5: Polish

```
1. Remove code duplication (DRY principle)
2. Improve naming
3. Add documentation comments
4. Performance optimization
5. Mark [x] in tasks.md
```

**Completion Criteria**: All tests passing and code quality meets standards
